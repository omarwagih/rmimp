Description: MIMP is a machine learning method that predicts the impact of
    missense single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) on kinase-substrate interactions.
    MIMP analyzes kinase sequence specificities and predicts whether SNVs disrupt
    existing phosphorylation sites or create new sites. This helps discover
    mutations that modify protein function by altering kinase networks and provides
    insight into disease biology and therapy development.
